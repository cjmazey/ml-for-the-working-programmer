** Exercise 2.1

   The SML/NJ interpreter can be started with
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sml
#+END_SRC

   A file "foo.sml" can be read in (as if it had been typed) with
#+BEGIN_SRC sml
  use "foo.sml";
#+END_SRC

** Exercise 2.2

   No. . .integers are exact.

** Exercise 2.3

   Just =g=.
#+BEGIN_SRC sml
  fun double n = 2 * n
  fun f u = Math.sin u / u
  fun g k = ~k * k
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: val double = fn : int -> int
: val f = fn : real -> real
: val g = fn : int -> int
